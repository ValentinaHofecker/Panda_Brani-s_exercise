### pip3 install segment-tree ???? doesn't work 


from segment_tree import SegmentTree

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]


obj.query(start_index, end_index, get_sum)
obj.update(index, value)

# here we are fitting our array
# into segment tree where t is
# taken as object of segment tree
# t will be used for performing
# operations on that segmentTree


t = SegmentTree(arr)
t.draw() ###??? How do I show the tree?? 

# here we are finding value
# of maximum number in a range
a = t.query(2, 9, "max")
print("The maximum value of this range is : ", a)

# here we are finding the value
# of minimum number in a range
a = t.query(2, 9, "min")
print("The minimum value of this range is : ", a)

# here we are finding the value
# of sum of a range
a = t.query(2, 7, "sum")
print("The sum of this range is : ", a)

# here we are updating the value
# of a particular index
t.update(2, 25)

# it will replace the value of
# index '2' with 25
print("The updated array is : ", arr)
